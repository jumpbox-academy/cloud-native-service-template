# Cloud Native Service Template
Welcome to the Cloud Native Service Repository! This repository aims to guide developers on how to code in a cloud-native manner, adhering to the principles of the 12-factor app manifesto. We provide alternative approaches to traditional application development, enabling you to leverage the benefits of cloud-native architectures.

# What is Cloud Native?
Cloud-native refers to the design and development of applications that are built specifically for cloud environments. These applications are typically containerized, dynamically orchestrated, and utilize microservices architecture. Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, resilient, and easily managed in cloud platforms.

# The 12 Factor App Manifesto
The 12-factor app manifesto is a set of best practices for building modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. It provides a comprehensive methodology for developing cloud-native applications that can be easily deployed and managed in cloud environments. Our repository explores alternative approaches to each factor, offering insights into how to embrace cloud-native development principles. For more details: [Link](https://12factor.net/)
